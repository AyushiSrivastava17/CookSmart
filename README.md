# CookSmart

A Flutter Project with the goal of helping users create meal plans with their intended amount of calories, sugar, and health conditions like diabetes taken into account.

## Overview
This app will give customers the chance to get detailed meal plans or single plans while incorporating more personal data. The app also allows health conscious as well as customers with health conditions like diabetes to have healthier alternatives to ingredients needed for the given data. The aim overall is to be able to provide recipes involving ingredients in the house and creating healthy versions of those recipes if needed. An app that can help a range of customers - from college students to middle aged people. 

### Demonstration of Customer's Journey through the app
The customer will be shown a questionnaire to answer questions about diet choices, caloric intake, allergies to be aware of, experiencing any health conditions that could be affected heavily by diet, and if they want a single meal or a meal plan for a day. 

This information is then given a chance to be further personalized by allowing the customer to add in custom ingredients - allows for meals to be shown from ingredients at home - to be incorporated in the recipe(s).

The meal plan or options for single meal are then shown to the customer with a nutrition info box available to see how much fat, calories, and sugar are in the meal plans and separate boxes for each single meal are placed as well. 

A detailed page of the nutrition, ingredients and cooking instructions for each recipe is presented to the customer to use and will have the option to be favorited and stored for future use added in. 

If health conditions are present in the given data, alternatives for certain ingredients and cooking tips will be added to help create a healthier version of the given meals with the same taste!

## Future advancements being made
- [ ] A personalized page to properly show the recipes for given meals
